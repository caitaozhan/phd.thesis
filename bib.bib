	abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspects of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.}

abstract = {Abstract Elementary building blocks for quantum repeaters based on fiber channels and memory stations are analyzed. Implementations are considered for three different physical platforms, for which suitable components are available: quantum dots, trapped atoms and ions, and color centers in diamond. The performances of basic quantum repeater links for these platforms are evaluated and compared, both for present-day, state-of-the-art experimental parameters as well as for parameters that can in principle be reached in the future. The ultimate goal is to experimentally explore regimes at intermediate distances—up to a few 100 km—in which the repeater-assisted secret key transmission rates exceed the maximal rate achievable via direct transmission. Two different protocols are considered, one of which is better adapted to the higher source clock rate and lower memory coherence time of the quantum dot platform, while the other circumvents the need of writing photonic quantum states into the memories in a heralded, nondestructive fashion. The elementary building blocks and protocols can be connected in a modular form to construct a quantum repeater system that is potentially scalable to large distances.},

pages={123},
abstract={The field of machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success over the past few decades and has become an integral part of our daily lives, powering various applications such as healthcare, recommender systems, finance, and social science. ML models play a critical role in decision-making scenarios, making transparency and explainability essential to building models that humans can trust. In response to this need, the artificial intelligence research community has been exploring the field of explainable machine learning (XAI), which aims to shed light on the internal logic and predictions of complex ML models. One important approach to XAI is the generation of model-agnostic Counterfactual Explanations (CFs), which provide insight into how a model’s output would change if one or more input features were modified. In this context, we introduce ReLAX, a sequential decision-making algorithm that formulates the generation of CFs as a task to be optimized via deep reinforcement learning. ReLAX can explain any black-box model trained on tabular input data, regardless of its internal complexity. In addition to ReLAX, we also discuss several other XAI algorithms designed for different tasks. In the first study, we formulate the costly feature classification task within the reinforcement learning framework and sequentially select the subset of features to balance the classification error and the feature cost. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and imbalanced-aware reward to guide the policy updating. In the second study, we focus on finding Factual (FA) and Counter- factual explanations for GNN-based recommender systems using a unified optimization framework. Overall, these approaches demonstrate the potential of XAI to provide insight and transparency into the inner workings of complex ML models, ultimately leading to more trustworthy and reliable decision-making systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces intermittent learning --- the goal of which is to enable energy harvested computing platforms capable of executing certain classes of machine learning tasks effectively and efficiently. We identify unique challenges to intermittent learning relating to the data and application semantics of machine learning tasks, and to address these challenges, we devise 1) an algorithm that determines a sequence of actions to achieve the desired learning objective under tight energy constraints, and 2) propose three heuristics that help an intermittent learner decide whether to learn or discard training examples at run-time which increases the energy efficiency of the system. We implement and evaluate three intermittent learning applications that learn the 1) air quality, 2) human presence, and 3) vibration using solar, RF, and kinetic energy harvesters, respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the energy efficiency of a learner by up to 100\% and cuts down the number of learning examples by up to 50\% when compared to state-of-the-art intermittent computing systems that do not implement the proposed intermittent learning framework.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) boom has revolutionized almost every corner of people’s daily lives: healthcare, environment, transportation, manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. With the recent development of sensor and communication technology, IoT artifacts, including smart wearables, cameras, smartwatches, and autonomous systems can accurately measure and perceive their surrounding environment. Continuous sensing generates massive amounts of data and presents challenges for machine learning. Deep learning models (e.g., convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks) have been extensively employed in solving IoT tasks by learning patterns from multi-modal sensory data. Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging and fast-growing family of neural network models, can capture complex interactions within sensor topology and have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results in numerous IoT learning tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in the application of GNNs to the IoT field, including a deep dive analysis of GNN design in various IoT sensing environments, an overarching list of public data and source codes from the collected publications, and future research directions. To keep track of newly published works, we collect representative papers and their open-source implementations and create a Github repository at GNN4IoT.},
