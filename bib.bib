journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
abstract={The field of machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success over the past few decades and has become an integral part of our daily lives, powering various applications such as healthcare, recommender systems, finance, and social science. ML models play a critical role in decision-making scenarios, making transparency and explainability essential to building models that humans can trust. In response to this need, the artificial intelligence research community has been exploring the field of explainable machine learning (XAI), which aims to shed light on the internal logic and predictions of complex ML models. One important approach to XAI is the generation of model-agnostic Counterfactual Explanations (CFs), which provide insight into how a model’s output would change if one or more input features were modified. In this context, we introduce ReLAX, a sequential decision-making algorithm that formulates the generation of CFs as a task to be optimized via deep reinforcement learning. ReLAX can explain any black-box model trained on tabular input data, regardless of its internal complexity. In addition to ReLAX, we also discuss several other XAI algorithms designed for different tasks. In the first study, we formulate the costly feature classification task within the reinforcement learning framework and sequentially select the subset of features to balance the classification error and the feature cost. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and imbalanced-aware reward to guide the policy updating. In the second study, we focus on finding Factual (FA) and Counter- factual explanations for GNN-based recommender systems using a unified optimization framework. Overall, these approaches demonstrate the potential of XAI to provide insight and transparency into the inner workings of complex ML models, ultimately leading to more trustworthy and reliable decision-making systems.},
