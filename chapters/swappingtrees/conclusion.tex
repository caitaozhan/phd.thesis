\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:swapping_conc}

We have designed techniques for efficient generation of \eps to facilitate quantum
network communication, by selecting efficient swapping trees in a \wt protocol.
%under fidelity constraints. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
By extensive simulations, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our \dpalt, i.e., compared to \dpa, it significantly decrease the time complexity
while the performance drop is only minor.
% and their viability in generating high-fidelity \eps over long distances (500-1000km).
%%%%%%%%%%
% Our future work is focused on exploring more sophisticated generation structures, 
% e.g., aggregated trees, taking advantage of pipelining across rounds, incorporating
% purification techniques, \tqbl{and to extend our techniques to multi-mode memories~\cite{simon07, collins07}.}
%to further enhance the high-fidelity entanglement rates.
