\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have designed and developed some novel deep-learning based scheme (\our) for
the multiple transmitter localization (\mtl) problem.
We extended this problem to localizing the intruders in the presence of authorized users and developed a novel technique to solve it. 
We also developed a novel technique that can solve the multiple transmitter power estimation (\mtpe) problem.
Solving the general \mtl and \mtpe are both achieved by utilizing our robust \our as a building block. 
We evaluated all our methods extensively through data simulated from two propagation models as well as a small-scale data collected from a real world testbed. 
Our developed technique outperforms prior approaches by a significant margin in all performance metrics.
%we would like to improve generalization by investigating the scenario when training and testing datasets are generated from two different geographical areas. 
%Lastly, for very large number of transmitters, we would like to explore crowd counting techniques, borrowing more from the computer vision community.}


%In our 
%For future work, we will try to train our two steps \imgimg and \yolocust end-to-end, instead of separately as we did currently.
%Also, we would like to evaluate our method in real world testbeds and see if the performance math the performance done in simulations.
