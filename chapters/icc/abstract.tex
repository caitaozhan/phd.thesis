In this paper, we present the first radio-frequency (RF) transmitter localization via a quantum sensor network and a quantum-based localization method. 
Localization of RF signals is a widely studied area in the past three decades. 
It has a great impact on human lives as
it serves as the basis of a variety of location-based services.
Meanwhile, quantum sensing is a new and interdisciplinary area that brings new opportunities to well-established problems.

We assume distributing some quantum sensors in an area that contains a single RF transmitter to be localized. 
We pose our transmitter localization problem as a quantum state discrimination problem and use the positive operator-valued measurement (POVM) as a tool for localization in a novel way.
Evaluation results show that our proposed method achieves a high localization accuracy in the discrete case and a low localization error in the continuous case.
