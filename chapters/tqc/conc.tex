\section{Future Directions}

Beyond proving the stated Conjectures in the paper, there are many generalizations of the addressed
\iso problem of great interest in terms of: 
(i) More general final states (e.g, two sensors may change at a time, allowing for multiple impact matrices $U_1, U_2,$, etc.), 
(ii) Restricting the measurement operators allowed (e.g., allowing only the projective measurements and/or local measurements~\cite{umd-entanglement}), to incorporate practical considerations in the implementation of measurement operators. 
We are also interested in proving related results of interest, e.g., \iso initial-state solution being the same for minimum error and unambiguous discrimination.
