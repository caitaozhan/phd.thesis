\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have developed effective schemes for an important quantum sensor
network application, viz., localization of a wireless transmitter. The work demonstrates
how a network of quantum sensors can collaborate to predict a parameter (here, location of an
event/transmitter) that is received/sensed differently at different sensor locations (e.g., depending on the distance from the event).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In particular, this work shows the promise of quantum sensor networks in localization of 
events in general---one of the most important applications of classical sensor networks.

Our work has significant opportunities for improvement. 
In particular, one can optimize the initial state of the sensors to further improve the localization performance (note that, here, we have only used a uniform superposition initial state).
In this context, we are also interested in determining whether
entangled initial states are helpful; recent 
works~\cite{swapping-tqe-22,predist-qce-22,ghz-qce-23} have shown that entangled states can be efficiently distributed over a quantum network. 
In addition, one can consider general multi-level approaches and restricted forms of measurement,
design parameterized quantum circuits with noise~\cite{quantumnas2022}, 
and develop techniques to distribute such circuits over a quantum (sensor) network as in~\cite{dqc-disc-q21, gdqc-qce-22, dqc-qsw-23}.

We plan to explore some of these directions in our future work.
