\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We introduce \povm and an improved version \povmpro that localizes an RF transmitter in a sensor network effectively and efficiently.
The approach utilizes quantum data obtained from a quantum sensor network and performs POVM measurements in a creative way to determine the transmitter location.
For future work, we would like to explore performing quantum measurements on a computational basis combined with quantum machine learning.
We would also like to explore more unitary operator models, as well as whether an entangled initial state's can enhance the localization performance.
