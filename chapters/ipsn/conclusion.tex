\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we have developed an efficient Bayesian approach with a noval interpolation scheme to
localize multiple transmitters in presence of authorized users, and
demonstrate its superior power over large-scale simulations and smaller
scale indoor and outdoor testbeds.

In our future work, we wish to extend our techniques to allow a
continuous location domain and design methods to further minimize
training cost. In addition, we will consider alternate signal
measurements such as angle-of-arrival (AoA).
